Problem Statement:

To develop an efficient traffic light control system, this project aims to leverage the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The current challenge lies in the inequitable traffic distribution across lanes, resulting in suboptimal time slot allocations for each lane. This imbalance leads to slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing.

The project's goal is to create a self-adaptive system that uses cameras and image processing modules to monitor traffic density in different lanes. Based on this real-time data, the system will dynamically adjust the time allocations for each lane, optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion.
